                I was born exactly 101 years after Dr. Seuss in Morristown, and grew up in a small, no-name town that Mike Tyson used to live in.
                Being a kid is a funny thing. You never quite know what is okay to say and what isn't. I still remember when my dad turned forty-four
                and I told him he was old enough to die. He thought it was funny, but in hindsight it was pretty morbid. But don't worry. I eventually
                figured out how to act socially normal.<br><br>

                When I was in freshman year of high-school, the covid-19 pandemic shook the world. At first, it was nice to stay home, but
                quickly it became clear that we all gained something by having to go somewhere to do school/work. To this day, I still feel like I am
                trying to bring some work-life-balance into my life, in the sense of being able to just loosen up and forget about everything for a few
                hours. It makes it hard for me to understand why some people would rather stay home and lose points than come into class.

            <p>In this article, I want to talk about image hover effects. They may seem really complicated at first, but they're actually quite inuitive.</p>

                The CSS properties that are going to come in handy here are opacity and transform.
                What you do is, you say transition: amount-of-time ease; and opacity: 0; in a CSS class.
                Then, for a different class you write .that_class:hover { opacity: 1; }
                It also helps to use transform property, though it is not necessarily required.
