# About Me (Jonas Welle)

## Purpose

What better way to show who you are than with a website? It can't just be flat, static text. It better be interactive and dynamic, adapting itself according to the user's actions.

On top of that, you can't make a website like this without learning certain skills along the way. Above all, I have learned how to: 

- Design a website with accessibility in mind. That includes how the UI is scaled between desktop and mobile, and how the color scheme looks to those with different types of color blindness.
- Organize a website into multiple sections. It can't just be one long paragraph explaining who I am. As was said earlier, it can't just be flat, static text. That would be too boring. 
- How to generate lorem ipsum text. This is a very important skill that heavily applies in many domains.

## Color Scheme

<span style="color: #00DBAB;">green</span><br>
<span style="color: #D9A602;">yellow</span><br>
<span style="color: #0293D9;">blue</span><br>
<span style="color: #D97802;">orange</span><br>
<span style="color: #2D6884;">dark blue</span><br>
<span style="color: #245C50;">dark green</span>

These colors have been specially selected to be clearly distinguishable for people with all types of color blindness. Beyond that, they also look pretty good in my opinion, even though I am not color blind.
